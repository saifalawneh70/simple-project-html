<h1>COMPANY</h1>

<p style="font-size: 170%">
 It’s a big job for any firm to motivate their European management teams to adopt new online working methods to solve traditional problems.

DS Smith’s new enterprise wide applications were exactly that.

What was important was to onboard everyone - and do it quickly, avoiding the common scenario where half a company is onboard and the other half quietly ignores or postpones adopting the new applications & methods.

Our job was to help DS Smith’s IT department sell the new apps internally by showcasing the new workflows as a series of 5 video modules.

For this we hired a cast of actors to dramatise common work scenes, show how the new apps were more effective, easier and quicker than the legacy work method they were designed to replace.

Filmed in Ghent, Belgium, the videos were spread over 5 modules - part of a series of 37 videos we’ve produced for DS Smith.
